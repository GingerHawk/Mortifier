I am not a developer by any stretch of the imagination and I don't pretend to be.  

Outside of the architecture of this generator, almost all the heaving lifting was done by several different AI‚Äôs as I learned which was best. 

Use at your own risk‚Ä¶which is minimal and it works pretty good

I use a lot of open source software in my personal life, and am planning on using Superset professionally. 

Outside of the occasional donation I have never really given back to the community that I have benefited from, so I spent a lot of AI tokens and wasted alot of water to get this done and learned a lot along the way

I am sure there are different or better ways to do what I jumbled together, I am also sure that someone out there will be able to take this and do something even better with it‚Ä¶I just wanted to give back

I am  just shamelessly coping the Apache Superset code, wiring in some custom controls and props statements and it works‚Ä¶

So A LOT of tokens were spent with a lot of AI agents, to build out the ~150 controls, props statements and generator so that when you use Superset you can customize the styling of the chart exactly as you would like.

I wanted to round the corners on a bar chart‚Ä¶that's it‚Ä¶I didn't even know what an Echart was
